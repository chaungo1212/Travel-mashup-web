FUNCTIONALITY OF EXPLORESCORT:

The 5 boxes grouped together on the far left will be used to send and
receive data from Trivago related to hotels.  All of them will be dialog
boxes, except for the one with the title "State", which is a dropdown
multichoice box.

Once this information is received, it will send the address of the hotel
to Yelp.  The user will then be able to search for businesses related to
whatever they're looking for by selecting one of the 12 radio buttons.
Further radio buttons located on the far left allow for the user to sort 
their results as they see fit.

Lastly, if the user wishes to use Uber to get from their hotel to the 
business, which can be determined by the raido buttons on the bottom,
our website will generate an estimate of the cost for that ride and
display it in the non-editable text box to the left of the Uber options.


GRAPHICS, ETC. OF EXPLORESCORT:

The color scheme will be as it appears in the sketch, maroon and white.
All dialog boxes, radio buttons, etc. will be outlined in black and not
gray.  Below these options, Yelp will be desplayed in a half window
followed by Trivago in another half window.  The sizes of the sketch will
likely not be their actual sizes.

The only picture we plan to use is the ExplorEscort logo seen at the top.
